/*
Proposal and Voting System:

Proposals can be created by users with unique IDs and descriptions.
Users can vote on proposals, with their votes tracked to prevent multiple voting.
Proposals can be executed if they receive more votes in favor than against.
Token Rewards:

Users are rewarded with tokens for creating proposals and voting.
Mock implementation for token minting and transferring to illustrate the reward mechanism.
Voting Tracking:

The system checks if an account has already voted on a specific proposal to prevent multiple votes from the same account.
Execution Logic:

Placeholder for proposal execution logic, which can include token distribution or implementing features based on the proposal.
This contract aligns with the goals described in the white paper by fostering community participation, providing incentives for engagement, and ensuring a transparent and fair governance process.
